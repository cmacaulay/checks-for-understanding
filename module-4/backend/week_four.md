## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week.

Note: When you're done, submit a PR.

* What's the purpose of a project management tool?
- Keep track of upcoming tasks and progress
- Stay organize across a group of people
- Stay current on progress
- Communicate around needs for specific tasks or aspects of a project
* What are the stages of a card when using Pivotal Tracker?
- Create a card, it goes into the Icebox/Backlog.
- Determine what kind of card it is (feature, bug, chore) - features receive point values estimating how long they will take to complete
- "Start" a card, which moves it to current iteration
- "Finish" a card, which means work is ready to be approved
- "Deliver" a card when code is submitted
- "Approve/Reject" if the code meets the expected standards
- Cards move into done the week after they are started
* What are the four types of cards available in Pivotal Tracker?
- Feature, bug, chore, release
* What's your favorite project management tool?
- Waffle
* Why do we create staging environments?
- To test production without pushing to production
* What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
- Organized in a sensical way
- Clear set-up instructions
- Clear communication on the purpose of the project - why might I use it? Why was it created?
- Using images, screen shots or video clips to help explain difficult actions or concepts
* What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
- Make sure all form fields have labels and not just placeholders
* What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
- Using sequential ID numbers can be a security risk
- There are all kinds of ways you can be hacked
* Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
- It is super helpful because it always makes sure that your tests run before you push to production, and lets you know what egregious errors you may have made that have broken your existing code base
* What are some continuous integration tools?
Jenkins, Team City, Travis CI
#### Review  

* What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
- Atomic commits (potentially rebasing to only include necessary commits)
* What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?
Inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism
* What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?
A class is an object and can be made up of methods that are specific to that object. A module contains methods that are not specific to an object, but instead that can be used by different types of objects - EG multiple classes can include the same module, and gain access to the methods defined within that module.
