## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
```
JSON is what APIs are generally displayed as (or XML). It takes the information from a database and outputs it so that it can be consumed by a front end or someone else who wants the data. The controller is where json is rendered. 
```
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
``` 
What is includes? Really no idea. Joins literally joins up two or more tables based off of like attributes. I'm assuming that includes will select different tables that include a specific attribute? 
```
3. What's an API?
```
Application Programming Interface - returns information from a database structured in JSON or XML in response to HTTP request messages. 
```
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
```
Response tests!
```
5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
```
jbuilder and active model serializers. 
```
